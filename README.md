# CTest
Hello, thank you for testing out this testing phase of whatever I'm calling my game.
Code is buggy and messy but I may fix that later. If you have issues, let me know.
I also have other creative projects that I'm working on so ideas are always nice, I can't always come up with ideas myself.
In terms of usage, feel free to modify the file but just don't steal my ideas or release what I have as a commerical product.
I know you won't, but don't do it.

Anyway, feedback is always nice so feel free to contact me with feedback or ideas, thanks.

Current Verion: 0.1.5
