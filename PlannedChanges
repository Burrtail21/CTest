To Do

-----

1. Focuses unlock new upgrades

2. Trust will increase max intel

3. There are spelling errors, I'm going to fix them, chill

4. More upgrades for 'money' branch


Planned

-----

1. Power branch, not sure if I want to make it 'power' as in electricity for your computer that things pull
or if I want to make it 'power' as in influence or whatever

2. More intel-based buildings

3. Redo the currency gain system so it uses all the buildings and values at once instead of giving them all their own functions.

4. Redo the purchase system with objects that define currencies used


Ideas

-----

1. Better formatting, upgrades to the right, buildings on the left

2. Increase effiency for showing upgrades using objects and executable bools

3. Stock market bot which can be upgraded using intel? 
Needs to display stocks it owns and buy stocks based on money it holds, requires planned #4

4. Either new verion availble notifications or website hosting

5. More progression branches

6. Upgrades use objects to determine what the upgrade does instead of giving each upgrade a new function
